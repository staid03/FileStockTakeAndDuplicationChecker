# FileStockTakeAndDuplicationChecker  

<h2>Abandoned</h2>  
  
Make a stocktake of files and separate work to figure out duplicates with different methods.  
  
This is a bit of a failed project here but I succeeded to a reasonable extent offline, using AHK, Python, SQLLite, and self-created JSON files and SQL insert scripts.  That is markedly different to what is here. This project is abandoned for now.
